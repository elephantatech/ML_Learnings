# ML Projects for learning

Below are some ML projects I was working on during my learning ML and here is the summary.

### [Boston Housing Prices Prediction Project](./Boston%20Housing%20Market/)

This project focused on predicting house prices in the Boston metropolitan area based on historical data using regression models. The following are key aspects of this project:

1. **Problem and Objective**: The City of Boston has launched an initiative to identify under-valued properties and increase their value for residents. To achieve this, we need a model that can effectively predict house prices in the Boston metropolitan area.
2. **Methods**: Regression models were applied for more accurate predictions.
3. **Data Preprocessing Steps**: Handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and handling skewness were employed.
4. **Results**: Train various regression models and identify which is the more performant model.
5. **Dataset Details**: The dataset includes 506 cases with features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, population density, etc.

### [Used Car Prices Prediction Project](./India%20Used%20Car%20Pricing/)

This project aimed to predict used car prices based on various attributes like year, kilometers driven, mileage, engine power, seats, and previous owner data using regression models. The following are key aspects of this project:

1. **Problem and Objective**: Cars4u needs a more accurate and reliable way to estimate the value of used cars for pricing purposes.
2. **Methods**: Regression models were applied for more accurate predictions, with data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, skewness, and populating data based on car names.
3. **Results**: Train various regression models and identify which is the more performant model for more accurate predictions.
4. **Dataset Details**: The dataset includes 6018 instances with features such as year, kilometers driven, mileage, engine power, seats, new_price, price previous owned, etc.

By using regression models on both projects, we aim to predict prices and develop profitable pricing strategies for different applications.
